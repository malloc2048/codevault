# Portfolio
This repo contains various random code exercises I have done over the years. 
There is not a particular theme or common purpose to the various projects.

# List of Projects
The source code can be found in the source/[project_name] directories.
The main CMakeLists file has the targets for all the projects.
Note that some of the projects are executable while others are built as a library.

Any documentation for a project can be found in documentation/[project_name] directories.
