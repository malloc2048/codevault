# Mathom House
Welcome to the Mathom house, a repository for the various random code exercises I have done over the years. 
Like the museum it is named after, there is no particular theme or common purpose to the various projects.

# List of Projects
The source code can be found in the source/[project_name] directories.
The main CMakeLists file has the targets for all the projects.
Note that some of the projects are executable while others are built as a library.

Any documentation for a project can be found in documentation/[project_name] directories.

* [Code Signal](code_signal/readme.md)

# Dependencies
* GTest
  * ``` apt-get install -y libgtest-dev ```
