# Portfolio
This repo contains some of the side projects and academic coding problems I have done over time.
I have forgotten why some of these projects were implemented, some are from various interviews throughout the years.
Some are probably just random things implemented for fun.

Some of these are probably pretty old projects so the style and C++ standard may be vary wildly.
The projects in this repo are all in C++ (I may make a second repo for porting to other languages)

## Summary of projects

Some implementations for similar questions asked during an Amazon interview

### Bloomberg
